Overview
This project applies various Machine Learning techniques to analyze the "2021 freeCodeCamp new Coderâ€™s Survey" dataset. The goal is to gain insights into the characteristics of new coders and predict their income levels based on their survey responses.

## README

### Data Analysis and Pre-processing

The provided Python script conducts detailed data analysis and pre-processing on the dataset 'slighted.csv'. It includes the following steps:

- Loading the data using pandas.
- Displaying the first few rows of the dataset.
- Printing information about the dataset such as its dimensions and data types.
- Conducting descriptive statistics.
- Handling missing values.
- Analyzing unique values in specific columns.
- Computing and visualizing correlations between numerical features.
- Plotting histograms for numerical columns.

### Model Selection and Justification

The script aims to implement cluster analysis and classification for understanding the characteristics of new coders and predicting high income based on developers' information. However, the specific models chosen for these tasks are not included in the provided script. Model selection and justification are crucial steps that should be added to this section. This may involve selecting appropriate clustering algorithms for cluster analysis and classification models (e.g., decision trees, logistic regression, random forests) for predicting high income.

### Effective Data Analysis & Evaluation Report

While the script provides a comprehensive exploration of the dataset, there is a need for a detailed data analysis and evaluation report. This report should summarize key findings, insights, and observations derived from the data analysis. It should also discuss the effectiveness of the implemented models in meeting the project objectives, along with any limitations or areas for improvement.

### Proper Use of Git and GitHub

This project should adhere to best practices for version control using Git and GitHub. This includes creating descriptive commit messages, utilizing branches for feature development or issue resolution, and effectively managing project tasks through GitHub issues.

### Code Quality and Best Practices

The script should ensure code quality and adherence to best practices. This includes proper variable naming, commenting where necessary, following PEP 8 style guidelines, and ensuring efficient and readable code.

### Proper Branching and Directory Organization

Organizing code into logical directories and branches is essential for project maintainability. This involves structuring the project directory with clear separation of concerns and creating branches for different features or tasks.
